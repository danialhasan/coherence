# Coherence Demo Script (1-Minute Video)

**Time:** 60 seconds sharp

---

## THE SCRIPT

### [0:00 - 0:12] THE PAIN

> **"Today's AI agents operate in silos. They can't coordinate. They can't share context. They can't work together.**
>
> **We built Coherence to change that."**

---

### [0:12 - 0:25] THE VISION

> **"Coherence is multi-agent coordination powered by MongoDB Atlas.**
>
> **A Director breaks down tasks and spawns Specialists. Every message, every checkpoint flows through MongoDB in real-time.**
>
> **Watch."**

---

### [0:25 - 0:45] THE WOW

*[Director + Specialists already running]*

> **"I have agents coordinating on a research task. Now I kill this one mid-execution."**

*[Click Kill]*

> **"In any other system, that work is gone."**

*[Click Restart]*

> **"But it loaded its checkpoint from MongoDB. It resumes exactly where it left off."**

---

### [0:45 - 1:00] THE CLOSE

> **"That's prolonged coordination. Coordination that survives anything.**
>
> **Coherence. Agents that coordinate. Agents that persist. Agents that actually work together.**
>
> **Thank you."**

## Pre-Recording Setup

```
[ ] Agents pre-spawned (1 Director, 2 Specialists working)
[ ] Task already submitted and running
[ ] One Specialist visibly "working" status
[ ] Record in one smooth take
[ ] Speak slightly faster than natural
```

## The One Line

> **"Kill any agent. Restart it. It resumes exactly where it left off."**
